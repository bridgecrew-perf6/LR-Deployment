1-Data Industry is split into 3 branches-Data Science,Big Data and Data/Business Analytics
2-Inside DS, we have statistics,ML,DL,RL,CV,NLP,AIOPS
3-Inside Big Data, we have ETL/pipeline,Data Engineering
4-In Data Analytics, we have reporting/dashboarding
5-Augmented AI??
6-1,2,3 always go hand-in-hand
7-ML-A way/process where a machine is trying to find out a pattern with the help of a mathematical model
  (the machine then tries to match any new data with this patten to check for similarities)
8-It is the mathematical equation of the algorithms that help it in identifying the patterns
9-ML will try to extract the best possible values of the parameters that can best describe the relationship
  or generalise across the entire dataset
10-The parameters will define the pattern/represent the r/ship
11-The smartest possible way to identify the best parameters-linearr r/ship b/n the variables
12-Machine actually never learns...we give the mathematical eqn.and the pattern and the m/c will
   try to extract the best possible parameters for the given eqn.
13-Categorization of ML-Supervised,Unsupervised and semi-supervised
14-Supervised-Regression & Classification-Both I/p and o/p
14.1-Regression-wherever we are looking for exact/concrete values
14.2-Classification-wherever we are looking for labels/classes
15-Unsupervised-Clustering
15.1-Clustering-Grouping o/n
16-Semi-Supervised-Regn+Classfn+Clustering-combination of supervised and un-supervised
17-DL-Also we try to find out a pattern-
